<p>interaction sounds of a bop-it extreme</p>
<p> users interact with a bop-it extreme through pressing the bop-it button (bopping it), flicking the green flicking sensor, pulling the blue pull tab, 
twisting the yellow twist sensor and sinning the red spin wheel.
</p>
<p>the context of the aforementioned interactions in my experience was between the years of 2002 - 2009. 
i familiarized myself with the interactions when i was by myself on weekends and early evenings after school. </p>
	
<p>the user initializes play by bopping the bop-it. they are then prompted by audio cues to preform one of 6 possible actions: 
	bop it, twist it, pull it, spin it, flick it or pass it. if the user successfully preforms the assigned task in the given time, 
	the toy will play an action-specific sound effect indicating the success. if the player is unable to preform the prompted task in the given time, 
	the toy will play a series of failure sounds. if the toy has not recieved input for a significant amount of time, it will announce its 
	shut-down with a voice saying "i'm going to sleep."</p>
	
<p>the tone/mood of the bop-its sound design is one of high-pressure competition, cartoonish sound caricatures, rhythmic consistency and, 
	as the bop-it extreme was released in 1998, significant audio compression. </p>

<p>hover your cursor over the image below to experience the bop-it's mood board of interaction sounds (the Gaming Siren 0:05 - 0:43). (the sounds might take a moment to load) </p>
