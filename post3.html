<p>soundwalk reflection</p>
<p> i decided to practice my soundwalk in a familiar location: somewhere in between sleep and my apartment building’s backyard.</p> 
<p>the soundwalk prompt was to walk around an object 3 times, listening more closely each time. i chose to walk around the first thing i noticed: a leaf.</p>

<p>the first words that come to mind when asked to describe this exercise is “difficult” and “tedious”. 
i perceived the sounds 99% objectively, and my mental and physical sleepy states only influenced 1% of the sound. this 1% was when i blinked, i heard sounds as though they were dreams. </p>

<p>i learned that some things stay the same while they change. </p>

<p>i wear jingly and jangly jewelry, so as i walked around the leaf, i added the chimes of my bracelets to the soundscape. i am always aware of the sounds i add to the environment. it used to bother me because making sound felt like pollution: not supposed to be there.</p> 

<p>if everyone was able to pause and listen, people would be able to appreciate things for what they are, not what they *could* be. a greater awareness and appreciation of what *is* would encourage people to not consume as much as they do.
