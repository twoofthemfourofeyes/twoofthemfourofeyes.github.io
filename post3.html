<p>soundwalk reflection</p>
<p> I decided to practice my soundwalk in a familiar location: somewhere in between sleep and my apartment building’s backyard.</p> 
<p>The soundwalk prompt was to walk around an object 3 times, listening more closely each time. I chose to walk around the first thing I noticed: a leaf.</p>

<p>The first words that come to mind when asked to describe this exercise is “difficult” and “tedious”. 
I perceived the sounds 99% objectively, and my mental and physical sleepy states only influenced 1% of the sound. This 1% was when I blinked, I heard sounds as though they were dreams. </p>

<p>I learned that some things stay the same while they change. </p>

<p>I wear jingly and jangly jewelry, so as I walked around the leaf, I added the chimes of my bracelets to the soundscape. I am always aware of the sounds I add to the environment. It used to bother me because making sound felt like pollution: not supposed to be there.</p> 

<p>If everyone was able to pause and listen, people would be able to appreciate things for what they are, not what they *could* be. A greater awareness and appreciation of what *is* would encourage people to not consume as much as they do.
