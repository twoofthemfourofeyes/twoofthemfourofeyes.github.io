<p>sonnenschein's "sound and image": points of interest </p>
<p>the article,”sound and image” by david sonnenschein focuses on how eyes and ears perceive time and space, 
	interacting to produce a whole story (Sonnenschein 152). the article goes through all the different ways 
	that sounds and visuals are used in movies. 
	it's crazy to read how sound is so influential on everything we perceive in day-to-day life. 
	we are over-stimulated with sounds. there are times when i have music playing, i’m talking to a friend on the phone, 
	i have my fan on, i hear the car engines outside: it is often very overwhelming and i just want all of it to be gone. 
	the reading details all the ways the media industry uses sound and visuals to manipulate what the viewer is feeling. 
	this is really interesting, yet also really scary to understand how complex our different sensory inputs are and how they can easily be exploited. </p>

<p>the first line in the article that stood out to me was “the intuitive nature of sound” versus “the categorical presence of sight”. 
	the combination of the two allows our minds to create internal images and relationships.</p>

<p>sonnenschein describes something called emanation speech. this is when speech is not heard or understood completely, 
	and it is not tied directly to the narrative line. it is verbally unintelligible and avoids emphasis on the meaning of the text. 
	it creates a silhouette of the characters.</p>

	<p>point of audition: there exists different layers of perspective (sight-based and sound-based), 
		which we can break-down even further according to the different senses we have. 
		this is really cool to me. in the “saving private ryan” case study, 
		the audience has access to the auditory information that private ryan is focussing on. 
		the audience is not watching a story from their personal perspectives, 
		but watching the story from the camera’s point of view and listening to the point of audition from a character in the story. 
		this is complete manipulation on so many different levels.
