<p>this class allowed me to consider sound in everyday life. </p>

<p>i was not aware of how almost everything in our man-made environment, 
including our interactions, neglects sound. through trauma counselling, 
i knew that human experience uses all of our senses along with rational thought to process a memory. 
the content of this class opened my understanding of human experience to a more interconnected understanding 
of how auditory sense (and other senses) truly affect our overall complex perception.</p> 

<p>i have become more aware of sound in media and in my everyday life, 
which has allowed me to see the current situation of the world in more light; 
that humans and our man-made environment has evolved to focus on visual and auditory perception, 
and of the two a heavy emphasis on visual perception. </p>

<p>when considering the current state of the man-made environment and human interactions, 
alongside how our human experience has changed over time, 
it is clear to me that our senses have evolved to become distorted or imbalanced. 
similar to sound being a complex element of film, i think these observations are merely one element 
of many complexities that have lead to the current world. this has allowed me to have a better understanding 
of the ways in which i feel disconnected from the world, as well as from my personal physical reality. 
thus providing me more resources and tools of which to aid my journey of healing and navigating this life. 
by being introduced to sound through things outside of me in ways that resonate with my experiences, 
it provides a new perspective to consider things within me. throughout my program at ryerson, new media, 
i have had trouble accepting technology into art as it did not feel like art to me; it felt imbalanced in 
a way that i did not understand. this resulted in me avoiding coding and programming classes, further 
isolating myself away new media art/artistry. this class really tied together my personal understandings 
of technology being a tool rather than a replacement or way of living, and how that reflects in the rest of the world. 
looking back to my inexplicable discomfort with new media, i have a better understanding of why i felt this way and 
can see how a lot of the ways technology is used in art (and everywhere) is used in a way that further emphasizes visual perception. </p>

<p>i am aware that this process of further distortion exists as complex elements that are interconnected,
as to not put any single focus blame per se on new media. since this is my current position in life, 
i now feel more connected to the direction i wish to take as an individual and as an artist so that i 
can learn to use technology as a tool for creating and expressing in ways that do not only/further emphasize visual perception. </p>

<p>by trying to live more mindfully and striving towards balanced consideration of my senses (human experience), 
i can create in a more balanced way that is more authentic and aligned with who i want to be as an individual human being. 
because art and creative expression are integral to my being, creating in a way that is more aligned with who i want to be will 
therefore allow me to exist and participate in society in a way that does not discourage me from wanting to live. 
i can now envision a way to live that allows me to put myself first and put others first; something that has otherwise been impossible. </p>
