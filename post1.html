<p>listening exercise reflection</p>
<p>from repeating the listening exercise in a different environment,
i learned that general and specific perceptions of sound are all the same.
one of the final listening prompts that was assigned in the exercise was
to identify one unpleasant and one pleasant sound.
i had a challenging time answering these questions.
all I heard became one. both pleasant and unpleasant at the same time.
the value judgements of "pleasant" and "unpleasant" all vary and fluctuate
depending on one's mindset.
at the time of practicing the exercise, i was feeling pessimistic about
living in the city. i projected my pessimistic mindset onto the sounds i heard,
and the city sounds of traffic and construction brought-up negative associations.
at the same time, though, i heard a squirrel scramble up a nearby tree.
i realized the life/sounds of the city and the life/sounds of the squirrel
happen on a spectrum; they all wind up being the same thing.
pleasant becomes unpleasant, and unpleasant becomes pleasant.
