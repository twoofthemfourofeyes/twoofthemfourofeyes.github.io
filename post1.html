	<p> <b>our sonic environment and the tuning of the world</b></p>
	<p>the first interesting thing was the idea that powers transfer from natural sounds to industrial sounds. 
		noise equals power. natural sounds, such as volcanoes and thunder, 
		were overpowered by religious-affiliated sounds such as church bells, organs and chanting. 
		this sacred noise turned into a different kind of sacred noise which was industrial noises. 
		this is how industrialists began holding power: they were the ones in control of the new sacred sound. 
		noise is power because it descends from god. God became the priest who became the industrialist who became the broadcaster and the aviator.</p>
		
<p>“to have sacred noise is not merely to have the biggest noise. rather it is a matter of having the authority to make it without censor.” 
	Without censor means without criticism, blame, approval or rejection. </p>

<p>the other interesting thing is the idea of sound imperialism. 
	the development of a social movement comes in two phases: 
	the cultural phase and the civilization phase. 
	imperialism is the extension of an empire or ideology to parts of the world that are different from the source. 
	once the sound can move beyond the source, it has more power. </p>

<p>local culture is quiet. Over the past 200 years, because the industries had to grow, the sounds had to grow with it. </p>

<p>learning about sound imperialism is important because it shows the way sound has changed 
	in the same way that power has changed and created a society that we don't quite understand, 
	but we understand it through sound. sound has increasingly and unceasingly grown science the industrial revolution, 
	while simultaneously resulting in the flatline of sound. because all the sounds have grown,
	they’re all the same kinds of low-resolution information, high-redundancy, continuous sounds. 
	even though the sounds have grown, if you look at them on a graph, they all get bunched together because of the same consistency
	over and over again and they generate a flat line. flat lines don't exist in space and are rarely found in nature. 
	long lines were built by factories and railway development. the continuous sounds (long lines) are permanent 
	keynotes or standards and strips of broadband noise with little personality or sense of progression. 
	this development mirrors how our society has become. </p>

<p>natural things are born, they flourish and die. our current soundscape is low-fi, 
	because there is no sense of duration or perspective; it isn't born, it doesn't flourish and it doesn't die. </p>

	<p>life has become something that is quantitative rather than qualitative. </p>

<p>the drone sounds are an anti-intellectual narcotic. 
	it’s a point of focus for meditation; being aware without judgement or intellect. man listens differently in the presence of drones. </p>


	<p><b>listening exercise reflection</b></p>
<p>from repeating the listening exercise in a different environment,
i learned that general and specific perceptions of sound are all the same.
one of the final listening prompts that was assigned in the exercise was
to identify one unpleasant and one pleasant sound.
i had a challenging time answering these questions.
all I heard became one. both pleasant and unpleasant at the same time.
the value judgements of "pleasant" and "unpleasant" all vary and fluctuate
depending on one's mindset.
at the time of practicing the exercise, i was feeling pessimistic about
living in the city. i projected my pessimistic mindset onto the sounds i heard,
and the city sounds of traffic and construction brought-up negative associations.
at the same time, though, i heard a squirrel scramble up a nearby tree.
i realized the life/sounds of the city and the life/sounds of the squirrel
happen on a spectrum; they all wind up being the same thing.
pleasant becomes unpleasant, and unpleasant becomes pleasant.
