<p>podcast reflection</p>
<p> 
this exercise taught me that podcasts can be anything from the human mouth. the medium is very versatile.</p>

<p>before this assignment, i thought podcasts were mostly audiobooks. i didn’t realize podcasts included people being 
themselves having a conversation. that really surprised me. my friend and i often joke about starting our own podcast, 
but i always assumed podcasts had to have a script or specific story to tell. finding this out made me sad, as knowing 
the podcast medium is open to people publishing more nonsense, meaningless online content is polluting the virtual world.
but, at the same time, listening to a particular conversational podcast was comforting: i learned the conversations 
i have with my friend are normal. </p>

<p>i cannot imagine myself listening to podcasts on the regular. this is because, so far, all of the podcasts 
i’ve listened to reference the news and current events. the news is not in my life, so i often have no idea what they’re 
talking about and i feel lost and not part of the conversation. </p>

<p>if i was to listen to a podcast, it would have to be more timeless, having nothing to do with what has happened recently. more random or narrative, and hosted by very genuine and *real* people.
