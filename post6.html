<p>the article ”sound and image” by david sonnenschein focuses on how eyes and ears perceive time and space, 
interacting to produce a whole story (Sonnenschein 152).  
the article goes through all the different ways that sounds and visuals are used in movies. 
it was extremely ear opening to read how sound is so influential on everything we perceive in day-to-day life. 
we are over-stimulated with sounds. there are times when i have music playing, i’m talking to a friend on the phone, 
i have my fan on, i hear the car engines outside; suddenly i become very overwhelmed with the sudden awareness of all 
the sounds and i just want all of it to be gone. this stems from moments of being overwhelmed with the concepts of my 
life but for whatever reason my focus shifts into the present moment of sounds, of which has become over-populated. 
it is fascinating to consider those experiences now: being stuck in the mind we see/hear the complexities of connecting moments. 
when i am able to focus on my present moment and realize how subconsciously i have controlled the nature of my auditory space to match my mind, 
i can then choose to turn off/limit the sounds in my auditory perception which immediately calms me down. 
the reading details all the ways the media industry uses sound and visuals to manipulate what the viewer is feeling. 
this is really interesting, yet also really scary to understand how complex our different sensory inputs are and how they can easily be exploited.</p> 

<p>the first line in the article that stood out to me was “the intuitive nature of sound” 
versus “the categorical presence of sight”. the combination of the two allows our minds to create internal images and relationships.</p>

<p>sonnenschein describes something called emanation speech. 
this is when speech is not heard or understood completely, 
and it is not tied directly to the narrative line. 
it is verbally unintelligible and avoids emphasis on the meaning of the text. 
it creates a silhouette of the characters.</p>

<p>point of audition: there exists different layers of perspective (sight-based and sound-based), 
which we can break-down even further according to the different senses we have. this is really cool to me. 
in the “saving private ryan” case study, the audience has access to the auditory information that private ryan is focusing on.</p>

 <p>the audience is not watching a story from our personal perspectives (how we experience life), 
 but watching the story from the camera’s point of view and listening to the point of audition from a character in the story. 
 this is complete manipulation on so many different levels. </p>

<p>in randy thom’s article, “designing a movie for sound”, sound design is analyzed through the current film industry process. 
the current understanding of what sound design entails does not correspond to the reality of the complexities that make up good sound design, 
as illustrated through the experiences of those involved in the sound design of film soundtracks that changed the way we think about film sound. </p>

<p>thom how today good sound design is loud sound, which is problematic. the volume of the sound is what defines the value of good sound, 
when in reality the volume of a sound is only one part of many other parts that make up the value of good sound. 
this resonates with the many ways in which i appreciate things differently than others; i have learned that my different perspectives
are not wrong but another aspect that makes up the whole. connecting this idea to other topics, i understand this dilemma through my 
favorite quote and one of my mantras by aristotle, “the whole is greater than the sum of it’s parts”.</p>

<p>in film, the sound design comes at the end of the process with very little consideration. 
anything that humans create is a simulation of experience. if a film is meant to simulate an experience 
of story through a particular human point of view, a film must do so by simulating the human experience. 
similar to the human experience, a film must being together complex elements of which are interconnected; 
working together despite complexity. i think the key aspect is similar to that of many if not all complications in the world, 
as connection is not the same as interconnection. we strive for something that in reality is 
interconnected but settle with the belief that connection is the same thing.</p>

<p>the article presents a solution to this problem by explaining that all elements are best 
considered and worked on together from the beginning. film begins with script writing, as such 
the sound design would be best to begin incorporating with the script. currently sound design is 
not considered in script writing for school and all parts of production focus on the storyline through the eyes/camera. 
changing the way this is taught would ensure sound equal status to image, which would not only benefit 
the industry but propel the possibility of harmony in the world in many ways.
